*This code filters the content of the global Activity Stream.

*The easiest way to do this is thru Dashboard > Youzer panel > Wall Settings > Control Wall Posts Visibility
*BUT these settings don't work all the time for everyone.
*Also, this code lets you customise the Activity Stream beyond the settings.
